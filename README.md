## Overview

This project leverages the DeepFace library to analyze facial expressions and detect emotions from images captured via a webcam. The goal of this project is to identify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprise, fear, disgust, and neutral. Based on the detected emotion, the system provides appropriate responses in the form of messages, GIFs, and sounds.

### Key Features:
- **Emotion Detection**: The project utilizes the DeepFace library to identify emotions based on the facial expression in real-time.
- **Interactive Responses**: Upon detecting the emotion, the system responds with a message, plays a relevant sound effect, and shows a related GIF.
- **Webcam Integration**: The system uses the browserâ€™s webcam to capture images and analyze emotions instantly.
- **Customizable Responses**: The responses, GIFs, and sound effects can be modified to match specific needs.
